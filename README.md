> Super Fast Deployments

In this article, we are going to explore yet another deployment option from AWS, which is about Deploying ASP.NET Core WebAPI to AWS App Runner, the latest Container based Compute Service from AWS. In earlier articles of the .NET on AWS Series, we have learned quite a lot of ways to provision your .NET-based backends into the Cloud using Services like EC2, ECS, Elastic BeanStalk, and even Lambda functions. Today, we will be deploying an ASP.NET Core WebAPI to AWS App Runner using Docker Images from AWS ECR as well as from a GitHub repository!
